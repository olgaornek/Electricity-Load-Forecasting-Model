# Electricity-Load-Forecasting-Model
This project focuses on developing an hourly load forecasting model using historical system load and weather data from 2004–2006.

Objective of the project is to predict hourly SYSLoad for January 2007 using data-driven time-series machine-learning Random Forecast and ANN models.

## Approach
- Clean and preprocess the dataset
- Engineer useful temporal and categorical features
- Perform exploratory analysis to understand demand patterns
- Develop and Compare two models:
- Random Forest Regressor
- Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
- Select the best model and generate forecasts for Jan 2007
